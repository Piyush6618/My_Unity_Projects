## 🧠 Game Logic Architecture

PlayerController.cs – Handles movement and input
ObstacleSpawner.cs – Spawns obstacles at intervals
GameManager.cs – Controls game state
ScoreManager.cs – Tracks and updates score
UIManager.cs – Displays UI elements

The architecture follows a modular structure.
Scripts are loosely coupled for easy scalability.
Game state is centrally managed.
